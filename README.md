## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I was able to familiarize myself with flexbox and learn to use it better. I also had to make a mobile responsive site and use a new media query code.

To see some code snippets, see below:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .container{
        display:flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning flexbox but also learn in the future Css grid. Continue the projects of responsive sites on different screens. 

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Web Design - Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me understand how to use media query.
